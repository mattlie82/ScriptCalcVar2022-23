\chapter{Functional Analytic Existence Results}
\label{ch:convexcase}
We already have learned the classical methods, i.e., 
searching for minimizers by studying their properties and critical points.
But the existence was somehow unclear, i.e. until now we only have some
sufficient conditions which are rather complicated to check.

To show existence, we need tools from functional analysis.
